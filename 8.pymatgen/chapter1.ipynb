    "Pymatgen is structured in highly object-oriented manner. Almost everything (Elements, Site, Structure, etc.) is an object. Pymatgen is heavily biased towards the representation and manipulation of crystal with periodic boundary conditions, though flexibility has been built in for molecules.\n",

    "The core modules are `pymatgen.core`, below is a quick summary of the various modules here:\n",
    "1. `pymatgen.core.periodic_table`: the element and specie (element with an oxidation state) objects are defined here, pymatgen's element object is rich, which includes many useful properties: atomic number, atomic masses, melting points, boiling points, and more\n",
    "2. `pymatgen.core.lattice`: define a lattice object, which essentially defines the lattice vectors in three dimensions. The Lattice object provides some methods for performing fractional to cartesian coordinate and vice versa, lattice parameter and angles computation, etc.\n",
    "3. `pymatgen.core.sites`: define the Site and PeriodicSite objects. A `Site` is essentially a coordinate point containing an Element or Specie. A `PeriodicSite` contains a Lattice as well.\n",
    "4. `pymatgen.core.structure`: define the Structure and Molecule objects. A `Structure` and `Molecule` are simply a list of PeriodicSites and Site repectively.\n",
    "5. `pymatgen.core.composition`: A Compostion is simply a mapping of Element/Specie to amounts.\n",

      "The INCAR file is the central input file of VASP, which determines what to do and how to do it. The INCAR tags specified in the INCAR file select the algorithms and set the parameters that VASP uses during the calculation. VASP will use reasonable default values, which we recommend using when unsure. Yet, the settings in the INCAR file are the main source of errors and false results, so we suggest carefully checking the meaning of the set INCAR tags. Regarding the format, each statement consists of the name of a tag, the equal sign =, and the values assigned to the tag (tag = values).

Because the mesh does not yield a good electronic density, it should only be used on a converged density. Therefore, run a calculation using a regular k-point mesh first. Freeze this density by setting ICHARG = 11 and run a non-self-consistent calculation with the line-mode k-point mesh afterward.\n",
